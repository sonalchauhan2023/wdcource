    <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a
        procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify
        as a
        function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship
        between the
        input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish
        to call
        it.</p>
    <pre>
                    eval()
                    The eval() method evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string.
        
                    isFinite()
                    The global isFinite() function determines whether the passed value is a finite number. If needed, the parameter is first converted to a number.
        
                    isNaN()
                    The isNaN() function determines whether a value is NaN or not. Note: coercion inside the isNaN function has interesting rules; you may alternatively want to use Number.isNaN() to determine if the value is Not-A-Number.
        
                    parseFloat()
                    The parseFloat() function parses a string argument and returns a floating point number.
        
                    parseInt()
                    The parseInt() function parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix (the base in mathematical numeral systems).
        
                    decodeURI()
                    The decodeURI() function decodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) previously created by encodeURI or by a similar routine.
        
                    decodeURIComponent()
                    The decodeURIComponent() method decodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) component previously created by encodeURIComponent or by a similar routine.
        
                    encodeURI()
                    The encodeURI() method encodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) by replacing each instance of certain characters by one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character (will only be four escape sequences for characters composed of two "surrogate" characters).
        
                    encodeURIComponent()
                    The encodeURIComponent() method encodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) component by replacing each instance of certain characters by one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character (will only be four escape sequences for characters composed of two "surrogate" characters).
        
                    escape()
                    The deprecated escape() method computes a new string in which certain characters have been replaced by a hexadecimal escape sequence. Use encodeURI or encodeURIComponent instead.
        
                    unescape()
                    The deprecated unescape() method computes a new string in which hexadecimal escape sequences are replaced with the character that it represents. The escape sequences might be introduced by a function like escape. Because unescape() is deprecated, use decodeURI() or decodeURIComponent instead.
